    \section{Social contract}

    \Ergo{} protocol is very flexible and may be changed in the future by the community.
    In this section we define the main principles, that should be followed during the \Ergo{} protocol updates.
    In case of intentional violation of any of these principles, the resulting protocol should not
    be called \Ergo{}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item{\em Decentralization first.} \Ergo{} should be as decentralized as possible.
        This means that any parties (social leaders, software developers, hardware manufacturers, miners and so on)
        which absence or malicious behaviour may affect the security of the network should be avoided.
        \item{\em Created for regular people.} \Ergo{} is the platform for regular people, their interests should
        not be infringed upon in favor of big players. In particular, that means that they should be able to
        participate in the protocol by running a full node and mine blocks (with small probability).
        \item{\em Platform for Contractual money.} \Ergo{} is the base layer to applications, that will be
        build on top of it. It allows to implement any kind of applications, but it's main goal is
        to provide efficient, secure and easy way to implement financial contracts. \dnote{probably kushti may write this better}
        \item{\em Long terms focus.} All aspects of \Ergo{} development should be focus on long-term perspective.
        At any point of time, \Ergo{} should be able to survive for centuries without expected hardforks,
        software or hardware improvements or some other unpredictable changes. As far as \Ergo{} is oriented
        to be a platform, applications built on top of \Ergo{} should also be able to survive in a long term.
        \item{\em Permissionless and open.} \Ergo{} protocol does not restrict or limit any categories of usage.
        It should allow anyone to join the network and participate the protocol without any preliminary permissions.
        No bailouts, blacklists or other forms of discrimination should be possible on core level of \Ergo{} protocol.
        On the other hand application developers are free to implement any logic they want, taking responsibility
        for the ethics and legality of their application.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Currency And Emission}

    %    подробная информация об эмиссии, скрипту эмиссии, и всему-всему что нужно для фаундейшена

    The native currency of \Ergo{} platform is \Erg{} token, which unique property is
    that it is the only currency to pay storage rent in \Ergo{}~(see~\ref{sec:economy} for more details).
    One \Erg{} token is divisible to up to $10^9$ parts labeled as \nanoErg{}.

    All \Erg{} tokens that will ever be circulate in the system are presented in the
    initial state and are divided in 3 parts~(boxes):

    \begin{itemize}
        \item{\em No premine proof.} This box contain exactly one~\Erg{} and is protected by the script,
        that is preventing it from spending by anyone.
        Thus, it is a long-living box, that will live in the system until storage-rent component will
        destroy it.
        It's main purpose is to prove, that \Ergo{} mining was not started privately by anyone before
        the declared launch date.
        To achieve this, additional registers of this box contains news from media (Guardian, Xinhua, Vedomosti)
        and block ids from already established cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum).
        Thus, \Ergo{} mining could not be started before certain events in the real world and in
        cryptocurrency space.

        \item{\em Foundation reward.} This box contain 4330791.5 \Erg{} that will be used to fund \Ergo{}
        development.
        It's protecting script is avaliable at~\cite{link to corresponding sigma tree} and consists of two parts.

        First, it requires that spending transaction should be signed by at least 2 of 3 secret keys,
        that are under control of initial team members. When they spend this box, they are free to
        change this part of the script as they wish, for example by adding new members to protect foundation
        funds.

        Second, it ensures, that only predefined portion of the box value was taken.
        During blocks 1-525599 (2 years) 7.5 \Erg{} will be released every block,
        during blocks 525600-590399 (3 month) 4.5 \Erg{} will be released every block and finally
        during blocks 590400-655199 (3 month) 1.5 \Erg{} will be released every block.
        This rule ensures the presence of funds for \Ergo{} development for at least 2.5 years and
        prevents an excessive wealth concentration under control of small group of people, as soon
        as at any point of time it won't exceed 10\% of total number of coins in circulation.

        \item{\em Miners reward.} This box contain 93409132 \Erg{} that will be collected by block miners
        as a reward of their work.
        It's protecting script is coded at \cite{link to corresponding sigma tree} and have several conditions.

        First it checks, that block reward is going to the exact miner, that solved the PoW puzzle, and
        may be spent not earlier than 720 blocks after the current block.
        This restrictions are done to prevent mining pools formation, see~\ref{sec:autolykos} for more details.

        Second, it ensures, that only predefined portion of the box value was taken.
        During blocks 1 - 525599 (2 years) miner will be able to collect 67.5 \Erg{} from this box,
        during blocks 525600 - 590399 (3 month) miner will be able to collect 66 \Erg{} and after
        that block reward will be reduced for 3 \Erg{} every 64800 blocks (3 months) until it will reach zero
        at block 2080799, that should happen roughly 8 years after the genesis block.


    \end{itemize}

    All these rules results in the following curve of efficient number of coins in circulation with time:

    \dnote{TODO: plot the correct emission curve - number of \Erg{} in circulation vs time. Miners and foundation part, like ZCash https://z.cash/blog/funding/}
