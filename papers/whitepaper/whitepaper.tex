    \begin{abstract}
        We present Ergo --- a new flexible and secure blockchain protocol.
        Ergo is designed to be a platform for decentralized applications with the main focus to provide
        an efficient, secure and easy way to implement financial contracts.

        To achieve this goal, Ergo includes various technical and economic improvements to established
        blockchain solutions.
        Every coin in Ergo is protected by a program on ErgoScript ---
        a powerful and protocol-friendly scripting language based on $\Sigma$-protocols.
        It specifies the conditions under which currency can be used: who can spend them,
        when, under what external conditions, towards which recipients and so on.

        Extended support of light nodes makes Ergo friendly for end users and allows to use these
        contracts from commodity hardware without any trust.
        To make contracts truly useful, Ergo is following survivability approach --- it uses
        widely-researched solutions that are not going to result in security issues in the future,
        while also prevents performance degradation over time with the new economic model.

        Finally, Ergo is a self-amendable protocol, that allows to absorb new ideas and
        improve itself in the future.
