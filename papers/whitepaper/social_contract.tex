\section{Social contract}
\label{sec:social}

\Ergo{} protocol is very flexible and may be changed in the future by the community.
In this section we define the main principles, that should be followed during the \Ergo{} protocol updates.
In case of intentional violation of any of these principles, the resulting protocol should not
be called \Ergo{}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\em Decentralization first.} \Ergo{} should be as decentralized as possible.
    This means that any parties (social leaders, software developers, hardware manufacturers, miners and so on)
    which absence or malicious behaviour may affect the security of the network should be avoided.
    In particular, this means that treasury funds~(see \ref{sec:currency}) should be distributed
    in decentralized manner after the initial 1 year period.
    \item{\em Created for regular people.} \Ergo{} is the platform for regular people, their interests should
    not be infringed upon in favor of big players. In particular, that means that they should be able to
    participate in the protocol by running a full node and mine blocks (with small probability).
    \item{\em Platform for Contractual money.} \Ergo{} is the base layer to applications, that will be
    build on top of it. It allows to implement any kind of applications, but it's main goal is
    to provide efficient, secure and easy way to implement financial contracts. \dnote{probably kushti may write this better}
    \item{\em Long terms focus.} All aspects of \Ergo{} development should be focus on long-term perspective.
    At any point of time, \Ergo{} should be able to survive for centuries without expected hardforks,
    software or hardware improvements or some other unpredictable changes. As far as \Ergo{} is oriented
    to be a platform, applications built on top of \Ergo{} should also be able to survive in a long term.
    \item{\em Permissionless and open.} \Ergo{} protocol does not restrict or limit any categories of usage.
    It should allow anyone to join the network and participate the protocol without any preliminary permissions.
    No bailouts, blacklists or other forms of discrimination should be possible on core level of \Ergo{} protocol.
    On the other hand application developers are free to implement any logic they want, taking responsibility
    for the ethics and legality of their application.
