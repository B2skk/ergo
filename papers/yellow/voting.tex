Many parameters can be changed on-the-fly via miners voting, namely instruction costs, computational cost limit per block,
block size limit, storage fee factor, block version, and so on. Voting for the block version~(so for a soft-fork)
lasts for 32 epochs~(see epoch length below), and requires 90 percent of the miners to vote for the change.
For less critical changes~(such as block size limit), simple majority is enough. We will further refer to the changes
of the first kind as of foundational changes, we call the changes of the second kind everyday changes.
Per block, a miner can vote for two everyday changes and also one foundational change.

To vote "Yes" ("I'm agree on the change proposed"), a miner is publishing identifier of the change directly in a
block header. To vote "No", a miner is simplry writing zero value in a corresponding byte. To initialize a voting
procedure, a miner is publishing change identifier in a first block of an epoch.


The value of the change is predefined as $\max(\lceil0.01 \times current\_value\rceil, min\_step)$ with $min\_step$
being the hard-coded value. In case the proposal fails, the parameters
remain unchanged.

System constants:

\item{} Epoch length = 1024 blocks.
