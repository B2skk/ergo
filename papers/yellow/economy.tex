\section{Economic survivability}

We outline following two properties required for long-term survivability of the chain:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{} Coins with lost keys should be returned into circullation.
    Otherwise, after the end of the initial coins emission, amount of the coins
    in the circullation always decreases and will eventually reach 0.
    \item{} Nothing should be kept in the state forever and for free.
    Otherwise, the size of the state is always increasing, reducing clients performance
    and thus increasing requirements to run a client.
\end{itemize}

To achieve this, we propose the following modifications to the consensus rules.
Register $R2$ of the box will contain tuple $(tx\_id, out\_num,
last\_height)$. $last\_height$ field is used to determine the block height
at the moment of transaction generation. Transaction can only be put in the
block of height $h$ if for every created box $R2.last\_height < h$.

Once the subsidized period for the box ends (that is,
$current\_block\_height \ge R2.last\_height + SP$), anyone (presumably a miner) can
create the new box with the exactly the same content (including the guarding
script) except the monetary value and $R2$ content. The monetary value is
reduced by $K \cdot B$, where $B$ is the box size and $K$ is the storage cost of one byte.
Thus, $K \cdot B$ coins are to be paid to the miner.
If box value is less that $K \cdot B$, all box content including tokens goes to miner.
$R2.tx\_id$ and $R2.out\_num$ content of created box should contain correct transaction id
and index, while $R2.last\_height$ should be set to $R2.last\_height$ of spending box
plus $SP$, to ensure that subsidized period starts over.

We propose the following concrete parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{} $K$ - cost of storage of 1 byte of data in a State for 1 block.
    Should be determined by miner votes, $10^{-6} (Ergo/byte)$ by default.
    \item{} $SP$ - number of blocks, box can be stored in a State for free untouched.
    Since Ergo have tokens as a first-class citizens, it might be possible that tokens value
    sufficiently exceed Ergo value in a box, thus $SP$ should be big enough to protect users
    that only keep tokens in their boxes.
    However, $SP$ should not exceed emission length to reward miners.
    It is predefined $SP = 1051200 = 4$ years.
\end{itemize}
