\section{Economic survivability}

We distinct 2 properties required for a long-term survivability of the chain:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{} Coins protected by scripts that no-one can spent (e.g. because keys are lost)
    should be returned into circullation.
    Otherwise after the end of the initial coins emission, their quantity
    in the circullation will reduce and will eventually reach 0.
    \item{} Nothing should be kept in the State forever for free.
    Otherwise State size will be infinitelly increase, reducing chain performance
    characteristics and increasing full nodes requirements.
\end{itemize}

To achieve this, we propose the following modifications to the consensus rules.
Register $R2$ of the box should contain tuple $(tx\_id, out\_num,
last\_height)$. $last\_height$ field is used to determine the block height
at the start of the subsidized period $SP$. Transaction can only be put in the
block of height $h$ if for every created box $h - max\_drift<R2.last\_height<h$.

Once the subsidized period for the box ends (that is,
$current\_block\_height\ge R2.last\_height + SP$), anyone can
create the new box with the exactly the same content (including the guarding
script) except the monetary value and $last\_height$.  The monetary value is
reduced by $KB$ where $B$ is the box size and $K$ is the storage cost of one byte.
Thus, $KB$ coins are to be paid to a miner.
If box value is less that $KB$, all box content including tokens goes to miner.
$last\_height$ is replaced with the new height that is at least
$current\_block\_height - max\_drift$, so that the subsidized period starts over.

We propose the following concrete parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{} $K$ - cost of storage of 1 byte of data in a State for 1 block.
    Should be determined by miner votes, $10^{-6} (Ergo/byte)$ by default.
    \item{} $max\_drift$ - maximum amount of time difference between transaction
    creation and it's inclusion into blockchain.
    It is predefined $max\_drift = 2016 = 3$ days.
    \item{} $SP$ - number of blocks, box can be stored in a State for free untouched.
    Since Ergo have tokens as a first-class citizens, it might be possible that tokens value
    sufficiently exceed Ergo value in a box, thus $SP$ should be big enough to protect users
    that only keep tokens in their boxes.
    However, $SP$ should not exceed emission length to reward miners.
    It is predefined $SP = 2102400 = 8$ years.
\end{itemize}
