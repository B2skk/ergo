# A New Quest for Decentralization

While most active conversations today in the space are about wider adoption of the blockchain technology (which often means
selling out to Wall St.) and competition with systems like Visa and Mastercard (which often means giving up with 
decentralization or introducing unclear security assumptions), there is the obvious need to revisit the roots of the 
cryptocurrency movement, which are mostly about decentralization. Many questions to be answered in clear here. Is it 
okay when 90% of mining power in Bitcoin [can gather in one room](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/673398201307664384)? 
Is it okay when 2 or 3 mining pools control majority of hashing power, so can do censorship? Is it okay when almost all
the new nodes avoid processing a blockchain from its genesis block? Is it okay when a Proof-of-Work coin developers are
doing a hard-fork changing the consensus algorithm to make it GPU-friendly again? Can we summarize all the issues with
decentralization? Can we cover most of issues with technical means?

Decentralization is about many issues lying in many fields, of technical, social and hybrid kinds. Researchers and 
developers are trying to find technical solutions, preferably, elegant and efficient. However, for many issues 
such solutions are not known, thus social solutions are also needed. 

## Decentralization of Mining

The two biggest concerns about decentralization of mining are specialized hardware (such as ASICs) and centralized 
pools. With ASICs, a big player capable to invest enough money into R&D can get unfair advantage from privately 
owned efficient hardware. In principle, for any kind of computational activity it is always possible to develop 
specialized hardware performing better than commodity computing units, such and CPUs and GPUs. However, for different 
computational tasks R&D efforts and possible outcome could vary a lot. Reasoning behind a search for a perfect (or 
close enough to perfect) could be quite complex (see e.g. 30 pages long [Equihash paper](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/48)).
